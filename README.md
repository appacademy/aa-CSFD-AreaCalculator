## Instructions

Using the solution for the Area Calculator Exercise, add the following features:

* Prompt the user to add a customer first and last name.
* Allow the user to set the price of a square foot.
* Use composite formatting to print a summary of the information.
* Print the user name in all caps as part of the details.
* One a new line, print the length and width and total.
* Print the overage using the percentage format code.
* Print the price of the total cost using the currency format code.

Example: JOHN SMITH.

The area of a 10 long and 10 wide space is 100 units. Adding in 5% overage is a total area of 105 units. With a cost of $2.00 per unit, the total cost is $210.00.

## Challenge

* Some countries use the comma to separate dollars and cents. Use Replace() to swap the commas and periods in the per unit and total cost.
